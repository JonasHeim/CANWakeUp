# CAN WakeUp

The intendation of this project is to create a device that will act as a Wake-Up source for CAN devices.
A microcontroller (STM32F103) send cyclic CAN wake up messages using an external CAN transceiver (TJA1050).

This project includes the schematic and layout files among the source code for the microcontroller.
